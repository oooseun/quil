# Quil Roadmap

Detailed progress tracker and future plans for Quil.

**Reflects shipped state as of v1.42.1.** Completed entries are ordered roughly
chronologically and tagged with the release that shipped them; anything below the
`In Progress` divider is unimplemented unless it says otherwise. When a feature
ships, update this file in the same PR — the `Completed` section is the answer to
"what does Quil actually do today", and it drifts fast when features ship straight
from a plan in `docs/superpowers/plans/` with no PRD in `docs/roadmap/`.

---

## Completed

### M1: Foundation
> Daemon, TUI, IPC, PTY, tabs, splits, shell integration, mouse, scrollback, daemon lifecycle.

All core infrastructure is in place. The client-daemon architecture works across Linux, macOS, and Windows. Shell integration auto-injects OSC 7 hooks for CWD tracking. Binary split tree enables arbitrarily nested pane layouts.

### M2: Persistence
> Workspace snapshots, ghost buffer persistence, shell respawn, reboot-proof sessions.

Workspace state (tabs, panes, layout, CWD) persists to `~/.quil/workspace.json` with atomic writes and `.bak` rollback. Ghost buffers capture PTY output to binary files. On daemon restart, shells respawn with saved CWD and ghost buffers replay instantly.

### M3: Resume Engine
> Regex scrapers, token extraction, AI session resume.

Session resume infrastructure is complete. The `preassign_id` strategy generates a UUID at pane creation, passes it via `--session-id`, and resumes with `--resume` after daemon restart. The `session_scrape` strategy extracts tokens from PTY output via regex for tools that don't support pre-assigned IDs. The `rerun` strategy re-executes the same command + args. Fallback to shell when resume args can't be resolved.

### M4: Plugin System
> Typed panes with TOML plugins, plugin registry, pane creation dialog.

The plugin system is fully operational. 9 built-in plugins ship with Quil — two Go
built-ins plus seven embedded TOML defaults written to `~/.quil/plugins/` on first
run (user copies override them):

| Plugin | Status | Persistence | Shipped |
|--------|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Terminal** | Production | `cwd_only` — restore working directory | M4 |
| **Terminal (wide canvas)** | Production | `cwd_only` — keeps content on squeeze | v1.34.0 |
| **Claude Code** | Production | `preassign_id` / `--resume` — session resume | M4 |
| **OpenCode** | Production | `session_scrape` via JS plugin hook | v1.12.0 |
| **SSH** | POC | `rerun` — reconnect with same args | M4 |
| **Stripe** | POC | `rerun` — re-listen with same webhook URL | M4 |
| **lazygit** | Tool | `rerun` — plus per-tab `Alt+G` overlay | v1.22.0 |
| **k9s** | Tool | `rerun` — kube-context pick via `discover = "kube"` | v1.27.0 |
| **lazysql** | Tool | `rerun` — connections stay in lazysql's manager | v1.28.0 |

Key capabilities:
- **TOML plugin format** — user-created plugins in `~/.quil/plugins/*.toml`
- **Plugin registry** with auto-detection (`exec.LookPath`)
- **Pane creation dialog** (`Ctrl+N`) — three-step: category, plugin, split direction
- **Error handlers** — regex patterns match PTY output and show help dialogs
- **Atomic pane replacement** — swap pane type in-place
- **Resuming/preparing spinner** — animated border indicator during pane startup
- **Window size persistence** — save/restore terminal dimensions across restarts

### M6: Pane Focus Mode
> Full-window focus for single pane (Ctrl+E toggle).

Ctrl+E toggles the active pane to fill the entire tab content area. Other panes keep running in the background, receiving PTY output. The layout tree stays intact — focus mode is a pure rendering toggle on `TabModel.focusMode`.

Key behaviors:
- **Ctrl+E** toggles focus on/off (configurable via `focus_pane` keybinding)
- Active pane resized to full tab dimensions; VT emulator + daemon PTY updated
- `[focus]` indicator in status bar
- Pane navigation (Tab/Shift+Tab) disabled in focus mode
- Split (Alt+H/V) and close (Ctrl+W) auto-exit focus mode
- Focus state is NOT persisted — restarting Quil returns to normal layout

### M8: Bubble Tea v2 Migration + Text Selection
> BT v2 + Lipgloss v2 migration, text selection, platform-native clipboard, editor enhancements.

Migrated from Bubble Tea v1.3.10 to v2.0.2 and Lipgloss v1.1.0 to v2.0.2. Added text selection, clipboard, editor selection/navigation, and beta disclaimer dialog.

Key changes:
- **Bubble Tea v2** — declarative View (`tea.View`), typed mouse events, `KeyPressMsg`
- **Lipgloss v2** — border-inclusive Width/Height semantics
- **Terminal text selection** — Shift+Arrow (char), Ctrl+Shift+Arrow (word), mouse click+drag
- **Editor text selection** — full selection/clipboard in TOML editor (Shift+Arrow, Ctrl+X/V/A, Enter to copy)
- **Editor navigation** — Ctrl+Arrow word jump, Ctrl+Alt+Arrow 3-word, Ctrl+Up/Down paragraph
- **Clipboard** — platform-native Read/Write: Win32 API, pbcopy/xclip
- **Bracketed paste** — Ctrl+V wraps content in `ESC[200~...ESC[201~`
- **Beta disclaimer** — startup dialog with random tips, "Don't show again" persists to config
- **Config persistence** — `config.Save()` for atomic config write-back
- **Go 1.25** — required by Lipgloss v2

### Pre-Built Binaries & One-Line Install — [PRD](roadmap/pre-built-binaries.md)
> GoReleaser cross-compilation, GitHub Releases, install script.

GoReleaser produces archives for 5 platforms (linux/amd64, linux/arm64, darwin/amd64, darwin/arm64, windows/amd64) with SHA256 checksums. Single `release.yml` workflow with two jobs: version bump + tag, then GoReleaser build + publish. Install script (`scripts/install.sh`) for Linux/macOS with checksum verification. Homebrew tap, Scoop, Winget deferred (need external repos).

Key capabilities:
- **GoReleaser config** — `.goreleaser.yml` (v2), two builds (quil + quild), `.tar.gz`/`.zip` archives
- **Automated releases** — conventional commit analysis → version bump → tag → build → publish
- **Install script** — POSIX shell, OS/arch detection, SHA256 verification, `QUIL_VERSION` pinning
- **Version injection** — consistent `-ldflags` across GoReleaser, dev.sh, dev.ps1, rebuild.ps1, Makefile
- **CI security** — actions pinned to SHA, per-job permissions, version format validation

### M10: MCP Server — [PRD](roadmap/mcp-server.md)
> Make Quil the AI's eyes and hands via Model Context Protocol.

`quil mcp` subcommand bridges MCP JSON-RPC (stdio) to daemon IPC (socket). AI assistants can read pane output, send commands, take screenshots, navigate tabs, restart panes, and control the TUI. No other terminal multiplexer offers this.

Key capabilities:
- **18 MCP tools** — Phase A (workspace control): `list_panes`, `read_pane_output`, `send_to_pane`, `get_pane_status`, `create_pane`. Phase B (interaction + introspection): `send_keys`, `restart_pane`, `screenshot_pane`, `switch_tab`, `list_tabs`, `destroy_pane`, `set_active_pane`, `close_tui`. Notification Center (M12): `get_notifications`, `watch_notifications`, `dismiss_notifications`. Memory Reporting (M13): `get_memory_report`, `get_pane_memory`
- **Official MCP SDK** — `modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk` v1.4+, typed tool handlers with struct-based input schemas
- **Request-response IPC** — backward-compatible `Message.ID` field for correlation; daemon responds to specific connection
- **VT-emulated screenshots** — `charmbracelet/x/vt` renders ring buffer into text grid showing actual screen state
- **Orange highlight** — pane border flashes orange during MCP interaction (configurable `[mcp] highlight_duration`)
- **Per-pane logging** — interaction metadata in `~/.quil/mcp-logs/`; two-layer redaction (AI markers + regex fallback)
- **TUI cooperation** — `set_active_pane` and `close_tui` use daemon broadcast → TUI handler pattern
- **Process exit tracking** — `Pane.ExitCode` and `WaitExit()` with `sync.Once` on PTY sessions (Unix + Windows)

### M12: Notification Center — [PRD](roadmap/notification-center.md)
> Centralized event sidebar with pane navigation and history stack.

Replaces manual pane polling with push notifications. A non-modal sidebar shows pending events; select an event to jump to the linked pane; `Alt+Backspace` returns to where you were (browser-back pattern).

Key capabilities:
- **Daemon event queue** — bounded, mutex-protected, survives TUI disconnects, replays on attach. Watcher pub/sub for MCP blocking tool
- **Event sources** — process exit detection, OSC 133 command completion with exit code, bell character detection (30s cooldown), smart idle analysis
- **Smart idle analysis** — when a pane goes idle (5s no output), last 4KB stripped of ANSI and matched against plugin `[[idle_handlers]]` patterns. SSH `[Y/n]` → "Waiting for confirmation", Claude Code prompt → "Waiting for input", password prompts detected
- **TUI sidebar** — toggled via Alt+N (visibility), F3 (focus+navigate). Severity-colored pane names (red/orange/blue). Status bar `[N events]` badge. 10s timestamp refresh
- **Pane history stack** — `Alt+Backspace` navigates back through previously visited panes
- **OSC 133 shell hooks** — bash, zsh, PowerShell emit command start/end markers. Zsh captures `$?` immediately via `local ec=$?`. PowerShell uses `[char]0x1b` for 5.1 compat
- **Plugin `[[idle_handlers]]`** — TOML section for context-aware patterns, parallel to `[[error_handlers]]`. Default patterns for terminal, claude-code, and ssh plugins
- **Plugin `path` field** — explicit binary location bypasses PATH lookup. 3-tier detection: path → LookPath → searchBinary fallback (fixes Explorer-launched apps on Windows)
- **MCP tools** — `get_notifications` (non-blocking) and `watch_notifications` (blocking up to 5 min, replaces polling). `requestWithTimeout` with `time.NewTimer` + `defer timer.Stop()`

### M13: Memory Reporting
> Per-pane memory accounting with status-bar segment, F1 dialog, and MCP tools.

A daemon-side 5 s collector (`internal/memreport/`) snapshots per-pane Go-heap (output ring buffer + ghost snapshot + plugin state) and PTY child resident memory. Surfaces it three ways: a `mem <n>` segment in the status bar refreshed every 5 s, an F1 → Memory tab/pane tree with expand/collapse and per-pane notes-editor byte accounting, and two MCP tools for external agents.

Key capabilities:
- **Cross-platform PTY RSS** — `/proc/<pid>/status` on Linux, `ps -o rss=` batched on Darwin, `GetProcessMemoryInfo` on Windows. No-op stub elsewhere
- **New IPC pair** — `MsgMemoryReportReq`/`MsgMemoryReportResp` with the daemon as the source of truth
- **Two MCP tools** — `get_memory_report` (per-tab totals + grand total) and `get_pane_memory` (single-pane detail). Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-20-memory-reporting-design.md`, plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-20-memory-reporting.md`
- **VT grid TUI memory deferred** — no stable public emulator accessor in `charmbracelet/x/vt` yet

### v1.8.0: Client/Daemon Version Handshake
> Eliminates the manual "stop daemon → replace both binaries → restart" upgrade dance.

The TUI handshakes with the running daemon before attaching. Older daemon → prompts the user, gracefully stops it, auto-spawns the matching daemon from alongside the TUI binary. Newer daemon → TUI refuses to attach and points to the releases page. Dev/debug builds skip the check.

Key capabilities:
- **New IPC pair** — `MsgVersionReq`/`MsgVersionResp` added to the protocol
- **Shared `internal/version/` package** — proper semver comparison so `1.10.0 > 1.9.0` (the previous lexical comparison had the opposite ordering)
- **Auto-spawn from binary directory** — finds `quild` next to the TUI binary, falls back to PATH
- **Unstamped local builds skip the check** — empty version string short-circuits the comparison

### v1.9.1: VT Drain + Update Watchdog
> Fixes a TUI freeze on claude-code pane creation; ships a stuck-Update detector for future hangs.

`charmbracelet/x/vt`'s `Emulator.handleRequestMode` writes DECRQM replies to an unbuffered `io.Pipe`. Quil uses the emulator as a renderer only (ConPTY is the real terminal), so nobody drained the pipe. When claude-code sent a mode query, `SafeEmulator.Write` blocked forever inside Update under its own mutex — single-keystroke wedge requiring a client kill.

Fix: per-pane goroutine in `internal/tui/pane.go` reads and discards emulator replies; shutdown via `em.Close()` → `io.EOF`, wired into `ResetVT` so no goroutine leaks on VT reset.

Watchdog: `internal/tui/watchdog.go` ticks every 2 s and, if a Bubble Tea Update has been in flight for more than 10 s, writes `runtime.Stack(buf, true)` to the log. Memoised per start-ns so one wedge produces exactly one dump; `sync.Pool` reuses the 1 MiB buffer. Eight new `apply: ...` breadcrumb log lines bracket each step of `applyWorkspaceState`. Seven white-box tests cover the logic via injected clock/stack/logger.

### v1.9.2: Claude Code SessionStart Hook
> Track session-id rotation across `/clear`, `/resume`, and conversation compaction.

Before this, daemon kept resuming the preassigned jsonl after a restart, silently restoring pre-rotation conversation and discarding the user's post-rotation work.

Quil registers a `SessionStart` hook via `claude --settings '<inline JSON>'` at every spawn (never modifies `~/.claude/settings.json`) and passes `QUIL_PANE_ID=<paneID>` in the PTY env. The hook script — embedded in `internal/claudehook/scripts/` (sh + ps1), written to `$QUIL_HOME/claudehook/` atomically on daemon start — reads Claude's stdin JSON, extracts `session_id`, and atomically writes `$QUIL_HOME/sessions/<paneID>.id`. On daemon restore, `resumeTemplateFor` consults this file and prefers the hook-recorded id over the original preassigned id.

Hardening:
- **`ValidateQuilDir`** rejects shell-unsafe paths before hook install
- **`ReadPersistedSessionID`** rejects pane ids containing path separators and caps reads at 256 bytes
- **Scripts validate** the extracted id against a uuid regex before persisting; failures land in `$QUIL_HOME/claudehook/hook.log`
- **Missing-script detection** at spawn time (`claudeHookSpawnPrep`) — falls back to pre-feature behaviour rather than registering a dead hook

### Notes Soft-Wrap
> Long prose in the pane-notes editor wraps onto the next visual row instead of being hard-truncated.

Pane notes (M7) historically truncated long lines at the panel edge with a trailing `~`. The notes panel is only ~40% of window width — every normal paragraph disappeared off the right edge.

Character wrap (not word wrap), opt-in per editor via a new `TextEditor.SoftWrap` flag — the TOML plugin editor and F1 log viewer keep their existing truncation. Cursor Up/Down walks visual rows with column preservation; Home/End snap to the visual row; shift-arrow selections stay contiguous across wrap boundaries; mouse clicks on a continuation row resolve to the correct logical column via a new `visualToLogical` helper. `ScrollTop` is reinterpreted as a visual-row index when wrap is on. Paragraph (Ctrl+Up/Down) and PageSize (Alt+Up/Down) jumps stay logical. Also fixes a pre-existing render bug exposed by the new path: cursor at end-of-line past a shorter selection was invisible.

### M7: Pane Notes — [PRD](roadmap/pane-notes.md)
> Side-by-side note-taking linked to individual panes.

A plain-text notes editor that opens next to the active pane on `Alt+E`. Notes are stored one file per pane and survive pane destruction, so the context you captured while debugging in a pane is still there next week when the pane is long gone.

Key capabilities:
- **Alt+E toggle** — opens the notes editor alongside the active pane (pane left ~60%, editor right ~40%). Mutually exclusive with focus mode
- **Read-only pane while editing** — all keys route to the editor so there is never ambiguity about where input lands. Exit notes to interact with the pane
- **Three independent save safety nets** — 30-second debounce auto-save, explicit `Ctrl+S`, and unconditional save on exit (`Alt+E`, `Esc`, close/split, TUI quit)
- **Per-pane storage** — `~/.quil/notes/<pane-id>.md`, atomic temp+rename writes, survives daemon restart (pane IDs are stable via `workspace.json`)
- **Notes outlive the pane** — closing or destroying a pane does not delete its notes file; browser ships in Phase 2
- **TextEditor reuse** — the existing rune-aware editor (selection, clipboard, multi-line paste, word jumps) gained a `Highlight` field so it can render plain text with no TOML colouring

### v1.17.0: Robust Restart — Lazy Restore, Log Rotation, IPC Backpressure
> Daemon restart survives a large workspace instead of stalling on it.

`respawnPanes` now spawns only the active tab's panes plus panes flagged **always resume** (`Alt+Shift+E`, `●` in the tab bar) before it starts listening; everything else is marked pending and spawned on first access. IPC gained a dual-queue design per connection — a must-deliver critical queue and a droppable live-output queue — so one wedged client can no longer block broadcast to the others. Log rotation (`max_size_mb` / `max_files`) landed in the same release.

Follow-ups: **v1.34.1** raised the client-side readiness wait from 2 s to 30 s (crash-aware, aborts early if the spawned daemon actually dies) and added a single-instance guard so a redundant `quild --background` defers to the healthy daemon instead of stealing its socket and orphaning it.

### v1.18.0–v1.19.0, v1.33.0: Agent Work-State Indicators & Hook-Events Pipeline
> The TUI knows when an agent is working, blocked, or done — from the agent's own hooks, not from screen scraping.

Quil registers hooks into Claude Code (native `quild claude-hook` subcommand, 12 events, inline `--settings`) and OpenCode (embedded JS plugin, `OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT`) at every spawn, never touching the user's own config. Events land in a per-pane JSONL spool, are rate-limited and debounce-coalesced by `internal/hookevents`, and flow through the existing notification pipeline.

Key capabilities:
- **Working spinner** — braille spinner on the tab label and the pane's top border while a turn or any background subagent is running. Subagents are counted, so a parallel 3-subagent spawn does not undercount to 1
- **Persistent unseen mark** (v1.19.0) — a completed turn leaves a green pane border and green tab label until you focus the pane. Replaced the old 5 s tab flash, which you missed if you were looking elsewhere
- **Blocked-for-input edges** — permission prompts and option prompts park the spinner and raise the unseen mark, then resume when you answer
- **Model + context segment** (v1.33.0) — AI panes show the last completed turn's model id and context-window token count in the status bar (`opus-4.8 · 612k ctx`), riding the same hook events with no new IPC. Compaction renders `· compacting` until the next turn reports the true reduced size
- **Hook health fallback** — if hooks never load, the legacy idle-pattern analysis still fires, so notification coverage degrades rather than disappearing

### v1.20.0–v1.21.0: Daemon Lifecycle CLI + Pane Restart
> `quil restart`, `quil daemon stop|restart`, and `Alt+R` to restart a single pane.

Bounded escalation for stopping a daemon — IPC `MsgShutdown` (5 s) → SIGTERM (3 s, Unix) → SIGKILL (2 s) — shared by the CLI and the upgrade path, with a PID-reuse guard that refuses to signal a PID whose image name is not `quild*`. `Alt+R` restarts the active pane through the same daemon-side kill+respawn the MCP `restart_pane` tool uses, behind a confirm dialog.

### v1.22.0–v1.29.0: Tool Plugins & Discoverability
> lazygit, k9s, and lazysql as first-class pane types; uninstalled tools stay visible.

- **lazygit** (v1.22.0) — built-in plugin plus a per-tab `Alt+G` overlay that drops into a git UI for whatever repo the active pane is in. Overlays are ephemeral: one per tab, excluded from snapshots, auto-destroyed when you quit lazygit. New `discover = "git"` plugin field lists repos near the pane's CWD in the setup dialog
- **k9s** (v1.27.0) — Kubernetes TUI with a kube-context picker backed by the new `discover = "kube"` field, reading context names only from `KUBECONFIG` / `~/.kube/config`, never credentials
- **lazysql** (v1.28.0) — database TUI; connection selection and credentials stay inside lazysql's own manager, deliberately with no Quil-side DSN picker
- **Greyed-not-hidden plugins** (v1.27.0) — plugins whose binary is not on `PATH` now appear greyed in `Ctrl+N` with a `homepage` link instead of vanishing, so the feature is discoverable before the tool is installed

### v1.30.0: Per-Pane Input History
> `Alt+Shift+I` lists every prompt you submitted to an AI pane.

Recorded by the Claude Code `UserPromptSubmit` hook (opt-in per plugin via `[command] record_history = true`), stored at `~/.quil/history/<pane>.jsonl`, ring-trimmed to the last 200 entries, and removed when the pane is destroyed. `Enter` opens the full text in the read-only viewer. Machine-injected turns (background-task notifications) are filtered on write, on read, and on compaction so they never pollute the list. OpenCode support is still pending — its message handler does not yet extract prompt text.

### v1.31.0: Bundled OpenConsole for Windows 10 — [ADR-25](architecture.md)
> Fixes the `Hello` → `H ello` caret gap when typing in AI panes on Windows 10.

The Windows 10 inbox console host re-serializes claude-code's incremental input render incorrectly. Quil now bundles Microsoft's OpenConsole (MIT) and routes the three pseudoconsole syscalls through it — on Windows 10 and older only, detected via `RtlGetVersion().BuildNumber < 22000`. Windows 11 keeps its unaffected inbox host. Falls back to the inbox host if the bundle is missing. Binaries are fetched at build time, not committed.

### v1.32.0: Mouse-Wheel Forwarding + macOS Render Fixes
> The wheel scrolls the app's own viewport in AI/TUI panes; claude-code no longer corrupts on Terminal.app.

Apps that enable DEC mouse tracking run on the alternate screen and never fill Quil's scrollback, so the wheel had nothing to scroll. The daemon is the authority on tracking state — it is the only component that sees the mode-enable burst on every attach, including reattach to an already-running session — and the client forwards each notch as the matching SGR or X10 sequence.

Same release fixed two macOS-only defects: the bundled emulator terminated OSC strings on a raw `0x9C` byte even mid-UTF-8, so claude-code's `✳` title spilled into the visible grid (doubled logo, `AAA` → `AAAude Code`); Quil now filters window-title OSCs before the emulator. And `Alt+<printable>` is forwarded as Meta so Option-based readline word navigation works.

### v1.34.0: Wide-Canvas Panes with a Native Threshold
> AI panes stop reformatting themselves every time the layout changes.

AI panes render on a window-sized canvas so grid, zoom, and sidebar changes never resize their PTY. v1.34.0 added the inverse: once a pane's inner width reaches `[display] min_native_cols` (default 80) it renders **natively** at its real size, which restores mouse and keyboard selection for free. Below the threshold it falls back to the canvas plus a preview crop, with mouse selection mapped through the inverse layout. The `terminal-wide` built-in exposes the same behaviour for shells.

### v1.35.0: `quil status`
> Scriptable daemon and session introspection.

Top-level command (alias `quil daemon status`) reporting daemon liveness, pid, version, environment, approximate uptime, and per-tab/pane session metrics with state and memory. `--json` for scripting; exit codes distinguish healthy / not-running / wedged.

### v1.37.0: Automatic Updates — [plan](superpowers/plans/2026-07-18-auto-update.md)
> Detect, stage, and apply a new release without leaving Quil.

The daemon checks GitHub releases 1 min after startup then every 24 h, publishes the result on the workspace broadcast, and can stage the download in the background. Staging is sha256-verified and extracts to `$QUIL_HOME/update/staged/<ver>/` with `manifest.json` written last as the atomic completion marker. Applying does a rename-aside binary swap with pair rollback, then respawns itself.

Key capabilities:
- **Status-bar segment** — `↑ vX [ready]`, plus an About-menu row that triggers a real check rather than repeating stale broadcast state
- **Two config knobs** — `[update] check` / `auto`, both exposed in the Settings dialog
- **Compiled out of dev/debug builds** — applying a release binary over `quil-dev.exe` would strip its baked-in dev-mode ldflag and silently attach the next launch to production `~/.quil`
- **Backup-slot fallback** — a backup file still held open by an orphaned process cannot be deleted or replaced on Windows, so the swap falls back to `.old.1`, `.old.2`, … instead of wedging every future update

### v1.38.0: Pane Context Menu — [plan](superpowers/plans/2026-07-19-pane-context-menu.md)
> Right-click a pane (or `Alt+A`) for its actions.

A compositor overlay, not a modal — it targets the pane under the cursor, highlights it, and dispatches into the same handler methods the keybindings use. Rows are grouped (view actions / pane settings / destructive) and greyed when unavailable (history without `record_history`, lazygit without the binary). Adds **Mark attention**, a pinned green border that survives focus, unlike the automatic unseen mark. Right-click with an active selection still copies.

### M11: Command Palette — [PRD](roadmap/command-palette.md), [plan](superpowers/plans/2026-07-23-command-palette.md)
> `Alt+Shift+P` fuzzy-find launcher — commands, tabs, panes, and pane content in one query. Shipped v1.39.0–v1.40.0.

A modal, centered, keyboard-first launcher. Entries are grouped under section headers with navigation first (Go to pane / Tabs / Pane / System); headers disappear as soon as you type. A greedy subsequence scorer rewards consecutive runs and word boundaries. Each row shows its keybinding, so the palette teaches the shortcuts as you use it. Default `alt+shift+p` only — `ctrl+shift+p` is intercepted by Windows Terminal and VS Code before Quil ever sees it, so it stays opt-in.

**Content search is unified into the same query** (v1.40.0), not a separate `/` mode as originally specced: every keystroke both filters the command list and fires a debounced search across every pane's buffered scrollback — all tabs, including background and muted panes. Matches appear under a `Found in panes` header with a match count and a preview line, and `Enter` jumps to the pane. Because hits are stored as ordinary jump-to-pane commands, cursor navigation, dispatch, and rendering all reuse the command machinery. A local timeout turns an unanswered request into a diagnosable row instead of an endless `Searching…`.

**Deferred to Phase 2:** per-plugin/instance quick-create, `:` direct-command mode, MRU ordering.

### v1.41.0–v1.42.1: Pane Setup Dialog — Recent Locations & Session Picker
> Two fewer keystrokes between `Ctrl+N` and a working AI pane.

- **Recent locations** (v1.41.0) — the last 5 committed working directories are offered as a one-keystroke quick pick, persisted to `~/.quil/recent-cwds.json`, with deleted folders filtered out. Git-repo discovery keeps priority; **Browse…** still opens the full picker
- **Claude resume-session picker** (v1.42.0) — see M5 below
- **Committed-value marker** (v1.42.1) — the chosen directory (and kube context) stays visible with a `▸` marker once the cursor moves off it or the field loses focus. Previously the selection highlight was drawn only on the focused field's cursor row, so the answer disappeared from the dialog exactly while you configured the rest of it

---

## In Progress

### Remote Daemon Attach — [PRD](roadmap/remote-daemon.md) · **BETA**

> `quil --remote gpu01` — the panes run on another machine and keep running when the laptop sleeps.

**Phase 1 shipped (beta).** SSH transport with no port opened on the remote host: Quil runs `ssh -T <host> "quil --stdio"` and speaks its normal IPC protocol over that one channel, so bastions, Tailscale/WireGuard, and public-internet hosts all work with no extra setup. The destination is passed to `ssh` verbatim, so `~/.ssh/config` applies unchanged. New `internal/transport` package behind an `ipc.DialFunc` seam (`Local` + `SSH` backends), shaped so a TLS backend can be added later. Every local-daemon lifecycle command refuses under `--remote` rather than acting on the wrong machine, and the status bar carries `[remote <host>]`.

**Phase 2 shipped (v1.45.0), hardened (v1.45.1).** A dropped link is a pause, not an ending: banner on the top row naming the host and what `ssh` said, input frozen rather than queued, redial backing off 500 ms → 30 s with jitter, and every pane's emulator reset before the replay so scrollback is restored rather than doubled. An attempt only counts as restored once the far side answers — `ssh` reports success the moment its own binary starts, long before it has resolved or authenticated the host. v1.45.1 stops retrying on failures that cannot fix themselves (rejected key, changed host key), since every retry is a full login and an overnight loop can get the laptop banned by the server's brute-force protection; `r` resumes. Verification against a real link is **partial** — two of eight manual checks — so treat the behaviour as shipped but not fully proven.

**Known limits — see the [PRD](roadmap/remote-daemon.md#known-limits) for the full table:**
- Filesystem dialogs (CWD picker, git/kube discovery, Claude session list) read the **local** disk — *Phase 3*
- Plugin availability is detected locally, so `Ctrl+N` greys out the wrong set — *Phase 3*
- `quil status` and the update controls are blocked rather than silently targeting the wrong host — *Phase 3*
- Six of eight reconnect manual checks are outstanding, chiefly reconnecting a pane whose plugin keeps no ghost buffer — *Phase 2 close-out*

**Planned:** Phase 3 remote-correct UI (four filesystem RPCs + plugin registry RPC) → Phase 4 mTLS transport, which the dialer seam already anticipates and which is the prerequisite for anything web-facing (M18 #18–19).

### M5: Polish
> Production-quality UX, plugin refinements, observability, encrypted tokens.

**Completed:**
- Default TOML plugins — claude-code, ssh, stripe shipped as embedded editable TOML files
- Plugin instance management — saved SSH connections, Stripe webhooks persisted to `instances.json`
- Plugin management UI — F1 → Plugins with view, reload, restore defaults, in-app TOML editor
- In-app TOML editor — full-screen editor with syntax highlighting and validation
- Pane creation dialog extended — 5-step flow: category → plugin → instance/form → setup (CWD/toggles) → split direction
- Centralized snapshot queue — event-driven with 500ms debounce, replaces scattered calls
- Per-plugin ghost buffer toggle — `ghost_buffer` bool controls PTY output persistence
- GhostSnap restore — clean ghost buffer replay after daemon restart
- Diagnostic logging — trace-level logging across daemon, TUI, and IPC
- Plugin configuration reference — comprehensive docs for custom plugin creation
- **Pane setup dialog** (ADR-15) — opt-in directory browser + runtime toggle checkboxes via `prompts_cwd` / `[[command.toggles]]`. Claude Code uses both: pre-fills CWD from active pane's OSC 7 directory and offers a `Dangerously skip permissions` toggle. Daemon-side CWD validation re-runs `EvalSymlinks` to defend the spawn against TOCTOU swaps. The `preassign_id` resume strategy now appends `ResumeArgs` to `InstanceArgs` instead of replacing, so toggle args survive a daemon restart.
- **Spatial pane navigation** (ADR-16) — `Alt+Left/Right/Up/Down` replaces linear `Tab`/`Shift+Tab` cycling. Picks the closest neighbour in the requested direction with three tie-breakers (gap, overlap, perpendicular center distance). Tab/Shift+Tab now fall through to the PTY so shell completion and Claude Code's mode-cycling work naturally. Splits moved to `Alt+Shift+H/V` so `Alt+V` reaches Claude Code's image paste.
- **Win32 clipboard image paste proxy** (ADR-17) — Quil decodes the OS clipboard image itself (`CF_DIBV5` / `CF_DIB` → DIB parser → PNG), saves it under `~/.quil/paste/quil-paste-<ts>-<rand>.png` with owner-only `0o600`/`0o700` permissions, and types the absolute path into the active pane. Sidesteps the upstream Claude Code Windows clipboard bug ([anthropics/claude-code#32791](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/32791)). New `Ctrl+Alt+V` and `F8` paste aliases — Windows Terminal eats `Ctrl+V` before it reaches the TUI.
- **Leveled logger** (ADR-18) — `internal/logger` wraps stdlib `slog` and bridges all 152 existing `log.Printf` sites at info level so old and new code respect a single filter. Configurable via `[logging] level` (`debug`/`info`/`warn`/`error`). Hot-path `Debug` calls pre-check `slog.Enabled` to skip `fmt.Sprintf` when filtered.
- **Read-only F1 log viewer** (ADR-19) — three new menu items (`View client log` / `View daemon log` / `View MCP logs`) reuse the existing `TextEditor` with a new `ReadOnly` flag that gates every mutation path. Tail-reads up to 256 KB at line boundaries with `[... older lines truncated ...]` marker. Symlink-rejecting via `os.Lstat`, plus a re-stat through the open handle defeats TOCTOU swap. `Alt+Up`/`Alt+Down` page navigation jumps by `[ui] log_viewer_page_lines` (default 40, configurable).
- **Project rule: dev-environment isolation** — `.claude/rules/dev-environment.md` documents the production isolation constraint for Quil's own contributors (Quil-on-Quil dogfooding).
- **Settings dialog persistence fix** — every Settings field now flips `configChanged` so edits actually persist on TUI exit (previously only the disclaimer setter did, silently dropping the rest).
- **Plugin registry hardening** — `LoadFromDir` prunes stale plugins on reload (deleted TOML files no longer leak in-memory entries); `validateSeverity` helper extracted; `searchBinary` Windows-PATH walk gated by `runtime.GOOS == "windows"`.
- **DIB parser hardened** (ADR-17 supporting) — per-axis cap (`maxDIBDimension = 16384`) plus `uint64` stride math defends against crafted clipboard payloads that slip under the 64 MB byte cap but would otherwise allocate gigabytes during decode.
- **Log rotation** — `MaxSizeMB`/`MaxFiles` now honored via `internal/logger/rotate.go` (`RotatingWriter`). Active `quild.log` / `quil.log` rotates to `stem-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.log` on size breach; newest `MaxFiles` archives kept, older pruned. Defaults: 5 MB / 10 files. No external dependency.
- **Observability — `quil status`** — top-level command (alias `quil daemon status`) reporting daemon liveness, pid, version, environment, approximate uptime, and per-tab/pane session metrics (state + memory), with `--json` for scripting. Exit codes distinguish healthy / not-running / wedged.
- **Mouse split-border drag-resize** ([PR #93](https://github.com/artyomsv/quil/pull/93)) — click and drag any border between panes to move the split. Ratio clamped in cells against subtree minimums (10×4 floor, nested splits included); adjacent panes show a transient highlight; PTY resize + layout persistence fire once on release (mid-drag only rects move — unpaired emulator resizes garble content). Border hit zone widened and given priority over the scrollbar's overlap cells. Disabled in focus/notes modes.
- **Claude Code resume-session picker** ([PR #105](https://github.com/artyomsv/quil/pull/105)) — the pane setup dialog gains a **Session** field (opt-in per plugin via `[command] sessions = "claude"`) listing the transcripts recorded for the selected folder, newest first, each row titled with the first prompt typed in that session. Picking one spawns `claude --resume <id>` in place of the `preassign_id` strategy's `--session-id <new>`; toggles still compose, and the pane joins the normal restore machinery from the first instant. New `internal/claudesessions` package owns Claude's `~/.claude/projects/<escaped-cwd>` naming rule (moved out of the daemon, so the rule that silently breaks restore when wrong exists once). Sessions held by a live pane are listed but blocked — the guarantee is enforced daemon-side under a claim mutex, not just greyed in the UI, since any IPC client can send an id directly. Press `i` on a row for details: start/last-used timestamps, typed-prompt count, transcript size, and the first and last prompts — read on demand per session, streaming the whole transcript but rejecting each line by byte-compare before any JSON parsing (88 MB in ~1 s).
- **Setup-dialog width accounting fix** (shipped with the above) — every content budget in the pane setup dialog reserved the box's padding but not its border, which lipgloss counts inside `Style.Width`; rows that filled their budget sat two cells past the wrap limit and reflow dropped the last word onto its own line. Session rows, the working-directory pick list, and the footer hints now all derive from one `setupTextWidth()`, pinned to lipgloss's actual behaviour by a two-sided test.
- **Client CWD propagation** (v1.11.0) — the TUI sends `os.Getwd()` on attach so new panes and tabs spawn in the client's directory, not the daemon's frozen-at-spawn-time one.
- **Tab drag-to-reorder, scrollbar drag, multi-binding keys** (v1.15.0) — drag a tab along the bar to reorder it (daemon stays authoritative, so a stale client never has to race for an accurate tab count); click-and-drag the scrollbar thumb with a 3-cell hit zone; any keybinding accepts comma-separated alternatives (`rename_pane = "alt+f2,alt+shift+r"` — F2 is eaten by macOS by default).
- **Notification broadcast hardening** (v1.16.0) — events carry the triggering output lines as an excerpt; per-pane mute (`Alt+M`) drops events at the source.
- **Per-pane restore activity indicator** (v1.26.0) — a checklist shows what the daemon is doing while a restored pane comes back, instead of an opaque wait.
- **Stop daemon moved to the About root menu** (v1.29.0) — behind a `y`-only confirm, deliberately not `Enter`, so finger memory cannot kill every pane child.
- **Wide-canvas terminal variant** — `terminal-wide` built-in ("Terminal (keeps content on squeeze)"): same shell auto-detection as the native terminal, but the pane keeps its PTY/emulator on the window-sized canvas below `min_native_cols` (like AI panes), so pane squeezes never cut content — at the cost of window-width output formatting while narrow. Native terminal remains the default for interactive work; proper reflow-on-resize is tracked below.

**Remaining:**
- JSON transformer (`Ctrl+J`) — format and highlight JSON in terminal output
- Encrypted token storage — OS keyring integration for sensitive scraped values
- Tab dock positions (top/bottom/left/right)
- OS service integration (`quil service install` — systemd/launchd/Task Scheduler)

## Planned — Core Features

### M9: Project Workspace Files — [PRD](roadmap/workspace-files.md)

> `.quil.toml` checked into repo — the "docker-compose.yml for dev environments."

Define workspace blueprints committed to git: tabs, panes, plugins, CWDs, commands. `cd my-project && quil` materializes the entire dev environment. Every team member gets the exact same setup. **Network effect within teams.**

> M11 (Command Palette) shipped in v1.39.0–v1.40.0 — see **Completed** above.

---

## Planned — Growth & Adoption

### The "Holy Shit" Demo — [PRD](roadmap/demo-gif.md)

> 30-second GIF: 5 panes → reboot → `quil` → everything snaps back.

The entire pitch in one visual. Goes on README, Hacker News, r/programming, Twitter/X. Adoption for developer tools is driven by a single viral moment. **Priority 2** — prerequisite for marketing.

### Community Plugin Registry — [PRD](roadmap/community-plugins.md)

> `quil plugin install aider` — community TOML plugins via GitHub.

GitHub repo as registry, `quil plugin install/search/update` CLI. lazygit, k9s, and lazysql now ship as built-ins (v1.22.0–v1.28.0), which is exactly the argument for a registry: each one cost a PR, and the queue behind them — Aider, Docker Compose, ngrok, pgcli, and whatever ships next month — should not. Every plugin makes Quil useful to a new audience.

### Native Docs on quil.cc

> Render the `docs/` markdown tree as first-class pages on the existing site.

[quil.cc](https://quil.cc) (Astro under `site/`, deployed to GitHub Pages by `site.yml` on master pushes touching `site/**`) already covers marketing: landing, features catalog, install, plugins, blog, comparisons. Its `/docs` page is a **link hub** that points back to the markdown on GitHub. The gap: render `docs/*.md` natively on the site (Astro content collections over the existing tree) so keybindings, configuration, plugin reference, and MCP guide are searchable, linkable pages with site navigation — no GitHub round-trip. Requires keeping `docs/` as the single source of truth (site consumes, never forks, the markdown). Also add a docs-freshness check: site deploys only trigger on `site/**`, so feature PRs that touch `docs/` or the feature catalog data layer must remember quil.cc (this PR added the drag-resize entry to `site/src/data/features.ts` by hand — content collections would make `docs/` changes flow automatically).

### tmux Migration Path — [PRD](roadmap/tmux-migration.md)

> Import keybindings and session layouts from tmux.

`quil import-keybindings tmux` reads `~/.tmux.conf`, maps to `config.toml`. `quil import-session` snapshots a running tmux session into an Quil workspace. tmux has millions of users — making switching painless is the fastest acquisition channel.

---

## Planned — Advanced Features

### Smart Process Health & Auto-Restart — [PRD](roadmap/process-health.md)

> Green/yellow/red health indicators, auto-restart with backoff, stale detection.

Elevate `error_handlers` to a first-class health monitoring system. Auto-restart crashed panes with exponential backoff, detect stale processes, fire desktop notifications. Plugin TOML `[health]` section for configuration. Moves Quil from "terminal organizer" to "workflow orchestrator."

### Cross-Pane Context Awareness — [PRD](roadmap/cross-pane-events.md)

> Build fails → AI pane gets a toast → one keypress sends context.

Event bus connecting panes: build errors notify AI assistants, SSH auto-reconnects, test passes flash green, webhook counters badge tabs. Creates an **integrated experience** that no collection of separate terminals can match.

### Terminal Reflow-on-Resize

> Rewrap terminal pane content on width change, like tmux and Windows Terminal.

Today a terminal pane's emulator crops on width shrink and ConPTY re-emits only the viewport, so content cut by a squeeze is not restored on growing back (`techdebt/3-5-terminal-vt-resize-reflow.md`). The fix is a reflow engine in Quil's emulator layer: rewrap screen + scrollback from soft-wrap continuation flags on width change (upstream `charmbracelet/x/vt` feature or a wrapper). Gives the native terminal the content preservation of `terminal-wide` without its formatting trade-offs — the endgame that makes both terminal variants converge. Epic-sized: wide-char cells, cursor remapping, alt-screen exclusion.

### Session Sharing — [PRD](roadmap/session-sharing.md)

> `quil serve --share` / `quil attach --host` for pair programming.

Remote workspace viewing and collaboration over TCP+TLS. Read-only by default, collaborative mode optional. tmux session sharing but with project context, typed panes, and AI session awareness.

## Planned — Competitive Gaps (herdr, AoE)

> Derived from the [competitive analysis](competitive-analysis.md) of the two
> closest direct competitors — [herdr](https://github.com/ogulcancelik/herdr)
> and [Agent of Empires](https://github.com/agent-of-empires/agent-of-empires).
> These are the 20 most interesting capabilities they ship that Quil lacks or
> only partially supports, grouped into candidate milestones. Several extend
> work already planned above — those are cross-referenced, not duplicated.

Both competitors are agent-orchestrators like Quil, but each is broader in one
axis: herdr on **agent breadth + scriptable extensibility**, AoE on **web/remote
access + sandboxing**. Quil already leads on **native Windows** (including the
bundled OpenConsole fix for Windows 10), the **MCP server**, **pane notes**,
**memory reporting**, **per-pane input history**, and **in-app auto-update** —
those are moats to defend, not gaps to close.

### M14: Agent Fleet — breadth + detection *(highest ROI)*

The starkest deficit: rivals detect 13–18 agents out of the box; Quil ships 2.

1. **Screen-content agent state detection** — infer blocked/working/done from
   terminal output for *any* agent, with no hooks required (herdr ships updatable
   TOML detection manifests). *Partly closed:* Quil now derives working / blocked /
   done from **hook events** for Claude Code and OpenCode (v1.18.0–v1.19.0, see
   Completed above), which is more accurate than screen scraping but only works for
   agents Quil ships an integration for. The gap that remains is the hookless
   fallback — output heuristics that generalise to an agent nobody wrote an
   integration for. Extends [process-health](roadmap/process-health.md).
2. **Broad agent support + detection registry** — Codex, Gemini, Cursor, Copilot,
   Droid, Devin, Kimi, and more, detected by process name + output heuristics.
   Still the starkest deficit: Quil's agent integrations remain Claude Code and
   OpenCode.
3. **One-command agent integration installer** — `quil integration install
   <agent>` writes the agent's hooks/settings for you (both rivals do this).
   *Partly closed by a different route:* Quil installs its hooks **per spawn**
   via inline `--settings` / `OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT` and never writes to the
   agent's own config, so there is nothing to install for the two supported
   agents. A registry-driven installer only becomes necessary at #2's breadth.
4. **Session fork** — branch a conversation into a new independent session, parent
   untouched (AoE).

### M15: Git Workflow — worktrees + review *(high ROI)*

The most-cited reason people adopt these tools: parallel agents on branches, then
review the diff.

5. **Git worktree-per-session** — auto branch + worktree on create, cleanup on
   delete (both rivals). Quil already has the `gitdiscover` primitives; the
   automation layer is missing. Extends [workspace-files](roadmap/workspace-files.md).
6. **Built-in diff viewer** — review, edit, and commit agent changes without
   leaving the TUI (AoE).
7. **Inline diff comments → prompt to agent** — annotate a diff; comments assemble
   into one prompt back to the agent (AoE). Builds on #6.
8. **Multi-repo workspaces** — one session/branch spanning several repos (AoE).
   Extends [workspace-files](roadmap/workspace-files.md).

### M16: Extensibility & scripting

9. **Executable/scriptable plugins** — any-language plugins with actions, event
   hooks, and link handlers, not just declarative pane types (both rivals). The
   biggest lever for a real ecosystem. Extends
   [community-plugins](roadmap/community-plugins.md) and
   [cross-pane-events](roadmap/cross-pane-events.md).
10. **Plugin marketplace** — GitHub-topic index + `quil plugin install owner/repo`.
    Already partly planned in [community-plugins](roadmap/community-plugins.md).
11. **General shell CLI to script the multiplexer** — `quil pane split`,
    `quil tab create`, `quil pane run` from any script. MCP serves AI agents;
    humans and shell scripts currently have no equivalent.
12. **Repo config + lifecycle hooks** — per-project `.quil.toml` with
    `on_create` / `on_launch` / `on_destroy` hooks (AoE). Natural extension of
    [workspace-files](roadmap/workspace-files.md).

### M17: Notifications & polish *(cheap, immediately felt)*

13. **Sound notifications** — audible cue when an agent needs you (both rivals).
    Extends [notification-center](roadmap/notification-center.md).
14. **OS / desktop notifications** — OSC / `notify-send` / `terminal-notifier` so
    alerts leave the TUI and work over SSH. Extends
    [notification-center](roadmap/notification-center.md).
15. **Themes + light/dark auto-switch** — multiple presets that follow the host's
    OSC 10/11 colors (herdr ships 18, AoE 8). Quil's theming is minimal today.
16. **Session lifecycle management** — auto-stop idle sessions plus
    groups / favorites / snooze / archive to keep a large fleet tidy (AoE).

### M18: Remote & Web *(largest builds; deliberate "later")*

Where AoE is pulling away for the mobile/remote crowd. Sequenced last because each
is a major surface and cuts against Quil's TUI/Windows-native focus.

17. ~~**Remote SSH thin-client attach**~~ — **Phases 1 and 2 shipped (beta)**,
    see [Remote Daemon Attach](roadmap/remote-daemon.md) under *In Progress*.
    `quil --remote host` works today and survives a dropped link; remote-correct
    filesystem dialogs (Phase 3) are the remaining work. Bridging local
    clipboard image paste into remote agents (herdr) lands with Phase 3, since
    it needs the same remote-path plumbing.
18. **Web dashboard** — real terminal + diffs in the browser, installable as a PWA
    (AoE). The single largest surface Quil is missing.
19. **Remote phone access** — expose the dashboard over a Tailscale/Cloudflare
    tunnel with QR + passphrase pairing and Web Push (AoE). Builds on #18.
20. **Container sandboxing** — isolate agents in Docker/Podman with shared auth
    volumes so they authenticate in-container without re-login (AoE).

## Strategic Notes

### The Developer Pain (Layered)

| Layer | Pain | Who Feels It |
|-------|------|-------------|
| 1. Context destruction | Reboot = 10-15 min of manual reconstruction | Every multi-terminal developer |
| 2. AI session loss | Losing a Claude conversation means losing reasoning context worth hours | AI-native developers (growing fast) |
| 3. Project fragmentation | 5 terminals + 3 tools + 2 SSH = no single "project view" | Team leads, senior engineers |
| 4. Onboarding friction | "How do I run this?" → README with 8 terminal commands | New team members, OSS contributors |
| 5. Cross-tool blindness | AI assistant can't see the build error in the next pane | Everyone using AI coding tools |

Quil currently solves layers 1-3 well. **Layers 4-5 are where the breakout potential lives.**

Items 1-2 (install + demo) cost almost nothing and are **prerequisites for everything else**. Items 3 (workspace files) and 5 (MCP) are the **strategic differentiators** — workspace files create team adoption and MCP creates the "AI-native" moat that no other multiplexer can claim.

### Feature Synergies

The **notification center** (M12), **process health** (advanced), and **cross-pane events** (advanced) form a layered system:

| Layer | Feature | Status | Role |
|-------|---------|--------|------|
| UI | Notification Center (M12) | Shipped | Sidebar, pane navigation, history stack |
| Signal | Hook-events pipeline (v1.18.0) | Shipped | Agent-reported work state, model/context, input history |
| Monitoring | Process Health | Planned | Health states, auto-restart, stale detection |
| Orchestration | Cross-Pane Events | Planned | Event bus, pane-to-pane context passing |

M12 shipped first as a standalone feature (process exit + output patterns). The hook-events pipeline then landed underneath it, feeding structured agent-reported events into the same queue — which is why work-state indicators, the model/context status segment, and per-pane input history all reuse it with no new IPC. Process health and cross-pane events are the remaining two layers; both extend the same queue rather than replacing it.
