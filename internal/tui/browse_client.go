// authentication with no ControlMaster to amortise it.

// A var rather than a const purely so the test binary can shorten it, in the

// no test detection, and production reads the value declared here. tea.Tick's
// Cmd blocks for its whole duration, and the test helper that drains a
// tea.Batch runs its children synchronously, so every test that issues a
// browse request otherwise sleeps the full eight seconds for a timer it is not
// asserting on. It is overridden ONCE, from TestMain — these tests run in
// parallel, so mutating it mid-run would be a genuine data race.

	// still-live slot and report a false timeout out from under it. gen (from

// applyBrowseDir cannot clear path/child back to a zero value on a match
// (unlike repoScanState, "" is a valid Path — the daemon's default CWD — so
// clearing to zero would make a genuinely idle browser indistinguishable from
// one mid-request), so the request's own timeout tick, scheduled alongside
// the send in requestBrowseDir, is still sitting there after a successful
// match and would otherwise fire 8s later and overwrite the listing it just
// delivered with a stale "timed out". gen is what tells a DIFFERENT request's
// tick apart from the CURRENT one when both happen to share the same
// (path, child) — the pre-fill chain and user navigation both funnel through
// requestBrowseDir, and a repeated pair is reachable in earnest (see
// browseState.gen). Without gen, request N's tick firing while request N+1 —
// for the identical (path, child) — is still genuinely pending would
// incorrectly report N+1 as timed out.
