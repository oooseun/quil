// TestMain shortens the client-side timers that no test asserts on.
//
// tea.Tick's Cmd blocks for its full duration, and runCmd walks a tea.Batch's
// children synchronously, so a test that issues a browse or git-discovery
// request pays the whole production timeout — eight seconds each, linear in
// the number of such tests, and multiplied again under -race. Shortening it
// here costs nothing: the tick still fires and still produces its *TimeoutMsg,
// runCmd discards that message rather than dispatching it, and the tests that
// DO exercise a timeout path call applyBrowseTimeout / applyGitScanTimeout
// directly with an explicit key instead of waiting for a timer.
//
// Done once, here, rather than per test: these tests use t.Parallel(), so
// assigning to the package vars mid-run would be a data race that -race would
// (correctly) fail on.
